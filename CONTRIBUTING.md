# Contributing to Trending in Artificial Intelligence

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this repository! It’s people like you who make this a valuable resource for the AI developer community.

This repository aims to track the **evolutionary timeline of AI for developers**, capturing paradigm shifts and notable projects as they happen.

### How Can I Contribute?

#### 1. Proposing a New Paradigm Shift

If you notice a major trend that isn't yet captured in our timeline (e.g., between "Personal AI Assistants" and "AI Cowork Spaces"), please submit a PR!

- **Format**: Add a new numbered section (`### N. Category Name`) in the appropriate chronological order.
- **Context**: Include a brief "Why this trend matters" section and at least one "Notable project".

#### 2. Adding Notable Projects

Found a project that perfectly illustrates an existing trend? We'd love to see it.

- **Criteria**: The project should have high "signal" (active community, significant stars, or unique innovation).
- **Format**: Follow the existing format strictly:
  ```markdown
  - **Project Name** — One-line description of the project.
    - Source: [URL](URL)
    - Signal: Brief description of its impact or why it’s trending.
  ```

#### 3. Improving the Timeline

If you find typos, broken links, or outdated "Signal" descriptions, please don't hesitate to fix them.
